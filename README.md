# Here i have done  analysis of my personal chat with my friend and predicted to the next word

### Below the library which i have used my analysis

1. numpy
2 .pandas
3. matplotlib
4. from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding,LSTM,Dense (i have used LSTM layer which is one the RNN network)

* I have done load dataset
* I have done data analysis,data cleaning,data preparation preparation
* I have done some NLP concepts
    1.Tokenize Data
    2.Sequence
    3.Pad sequences
    4.one-hot encoding
* I have created the simple LSTM model to trained my model with sample data 

* once i trained my model with sample data then i have test my model which means i have tried to predict the next word
  it was working it was predicted the right word.

Here i have share sample text data as well you can use educational purpose only.
